I am a freelance hardware and firmware developer. By taking care of both hardware and firmware in a design, I ensure that both hardware and firmware are optimized for each other, resulting in a better product.
# Hardware competences:
* schematics and PCB design, using KiCAD
* STM32, ESP32
* I2C sensors
* SPI devices, eg. e-paper displays
* each design has a CI/CD style workflow, taking care of automatic testing, BOM production and validation, etc. 

# Firmware Competences
* bare metal frameworks
* STM32, ESP32, ARM
* C++
* Test-Driven Design Methodology (TDD)
